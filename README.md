# Sample-webpage
This webpage displays an example of what I have developed using SharePoint. I had made AJAX calls to Sharepoint lists to get the link which would open on each button click. This github code doesn't include the aspects of fetching the website links from the SP List.
This is a sample webpage developed, suitable for any business/organization. This was developed as one of the tasks under the TMX team of Dell technologies under SharePoint environment. Main technologies and coding languages used are HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX.
